# GitHub-Tips-&-Tricks

## Delete Files
Method 1: Deleting a File via the GitHub Web Interface
- Navigate to the Repository: Log in to your GitHub account and go to the repository containing the file you want to delete.
- Locate and Select the File: Browse through the repository's files and click on the specific file you intend to remove.
- Initiate Deletion: On the file's page, locate and click the trash can icon (🗑️) or a three-dot menu, and then select "Delete file."
- Commit Changes: You will be prompted to commit the changes. Provide a concise commit message describing the deletion.
- Confirm Deletion: Click "Commit changes" to finalize the deletion. The file will be removed from the repository.

## Move Files
Using the GitHub Web Interface:
- Navigate to the file: In your repository, locate and click on the file you want to move.
- Enter edit mode: Click the pencil icon (Edit this file) to open the file editor.
- Modify the filename path: In the filename field at the top, change the path to include the new directory where you want the file to reside. For example, to move my_file.bin to a new_folder, change the filename from my_file.bin to new_folder/my_file.bin. If the new_folder does not exist, GitHub will create it.
- Commit changes: Provide a commit message and optionally a description. Decide whether to commit directly to the current branch or create a new branch, then click "Commit changes" or "Propose changes."
